##Description
The tutorial demonstrates a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project makes use of HTML and CSS on the front-end and for the styling. The back-end logic of the calculator is written using JavaScript which is one of the leading languages in the web development domain.

##Logical Description

Three functions are written in JavaScript which helps us compute the results when given the operands to compute with.
The functions are calc(), display() and clr().

1)	The calc() function inputs both the operands and performs the specified operation. 
2)	The display() function takes care of displaying the entire process on the display section of the calculator. 
3)	The clr() function helps clear the contents on the display section of the calculator.
